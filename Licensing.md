## Why do we have licensing in the first place?
Short answer is because of Standard and Premium connectors.

Premium connectors cannot be utilized without having Premium licenses.

Standard Connectors examples:
- SharePoint
- OneDrive for Business
- Adobe Acrobat Sign
- Approvals
- Dropbox
  
Premium Connectors examples
- Dataverse
- Azure Automation
- Salesforce
- SAP
- ServiceNow
  
Custom connectors allows you to connect to APIs or services that are not available through the built-in standard or premium connectors. This flexibility is powerful but comes with the requirement for premium licensing.

## Seeded Licenses
Working with standard connectors are covered under seeded licenses.

## Power Apps Premium Licenses
To utilize premium connectors, users (Power Apps Editor and Consumer), both would need to have premium licenses.
